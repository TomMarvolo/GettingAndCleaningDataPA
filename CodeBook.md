The Data
---

The data for this data set was derived from [source](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). Part of the description below has been taken from the original [Data Description Here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals (In our Data its represented by 'Acc XYZ' and 'Gyro XYZ'). These time domain signals (Using 't' prefix) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (represented with 'Body' and 'Gravity') using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (`r'Acc_Jerk'` and `r'Gyro_Jerk'`).

Finally the set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

*mean: Mean value
*std: Standard deviation
